# Andrea Portfolio Clone

This project is a pixel-perfect recreation of the Andrea portfolio template hosted on Framer, built entirely with React, GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), and CSS. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to replicate intricate designs and functionality from Framer while leveraging modern web development tools and frameworks.

## Project Overview

The [Andrea Portfolio Clone](https://andreatemplate.framer.website/) is a fully responsive, interactive portfolio site that mirrors the original Framer design with absolute precision. The project emphasizes meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that every layout element, color scheme, and animation sequence is faithfully reproduced. This clone also showcases advanced front-end development techniques, focusing on user experience and performance optimization.

* React is used to structure the components and manage state, allowing for scalable and maintainable code.
* GSAP is leveraged to implement smooth, high-performance animations that bring the portfolio site to life, mimicking the dynamic transitions and effects seen in the original template.
* CSS is employed to perfect the styling and responsiveness, ensuring that the design works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.


This clone serves as a robust learning exercise in web animation, component-based architecture, and responsive design. By utilizing GSAP for animations and React for component logic, the project aims to achieve a seamless and engaging user experience.

### Features:

* Smooth animations and transitions powered by GSAP.
* Fully responsive layout with pixel-perfect precision.
* Interactive and dynamic portfolio components.
* A clean, modern UI mimicking the Framer original, optimized for both desktop and mobile platforms.
